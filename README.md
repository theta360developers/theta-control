About
=====

*Theta Control* is a Firefox OS app for remote controlling the Ricoh Theta 360°
panorama camera.

It is available on [Firefox Markteplace][4].


Development
===========

Requirements
------------

  * [Compass][1]: To compile the SCSS into CSS.

  * [Node.js][5]: To create `package.zip` for distribution.

  * [ptp.js][3]: JavaScript PTP/IP library in version 2

    Install into: `package/vendor/ptp.js`

Coding conventions
------------------

  * Code needs to validate with JSLint.

  * Comments are in Markdown.

  * Don’t use constructors: JavaScript is a classless language.

  * Don’t throw exceptions. JavaScript is a weakly typed language, allowing
    functions to return different types of values, including types indicating
    errors.

  * Versioning: [major.minor.patch][6]

Publishing a new version
------------------------

 1. Install dependencies, if needed.

 2. Refresh CSS:

        $ cd package
        $ compass compile

 3. Keep version up to date in:

      + Git tags

      + `package/manifest.webapp`

 4. Create package:

        $ cd package-zip-creator
        $ npm update
        $ node app

 5. Publish to:

      + [github.com/feklee/theta-control][7]

      + Firefox Marketplace: [Theta Control][8]

Reading
-------

Yasuhiro Fujii’s article [“Play with Ricoh THETA w/o Smartphones”][2] lists
commands and device properties that can be accessed by PTP/IP.
